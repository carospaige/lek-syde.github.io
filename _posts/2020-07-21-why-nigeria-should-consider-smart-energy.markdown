<p>I have really been looking at the concept of smart energy and the benefits it can offer to my home country Nigeria. </p>

<p>Smart Energy encompasses the entire energy chain from ensuring the right amount of energy is generated to meet the demand but that fuel isn't wasted by creating an oversupply.

To reach this level we would need to understand the consumption profiles of users and this would in turn influence pricing. 

</p>

I believe Discos (Power Distribution Companies) would stand a greater chance of improving supply and making money by not just distributing power but also understanding the consumption profiles of its users and sending the right amount of energy to these users.


Countries like Germany are well on their way to deployment of Smart energy meters and there is soo much more smart meters can offer asides just metering. 
Yes, we might not be generating enough power as of yet, but what are we doing with what we are currently generating. 
we need to look at how we can generate as well as distribute efficiently. 

I can only hope would get there soon. 

CWG (Computer Warehouse Group) is saying they have a solution, I believe we can look into
