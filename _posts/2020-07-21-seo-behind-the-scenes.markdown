<p>Everybody wants to appear on the first page of google search results and frankly, I think every business should consider having measures in place for effective SEO </p> 
Page Rank is the algorithm at the heart of google search engine. Page rank in itself is not a search algorithm but a ranking algorithm.
What happens is when you type a query into a search engine, there are literally millions of website that matches that query. what page rank does is to rank these pages (websites) such that the one at the top is one you are most likely to be interested in.

'Page rank is still one of the reasons why Google search engine is on better than other search engines'

how does page rank work?
we can illustrate how by painting a scenario of players playing on a football field. where the players are the pages (websites) and pass to these players are the web links (external links)

Generally speaking, the page rank would give preference (higher rank) to a website if it has a lot of links coming from other websites. so in the case of a football field, the player that gets more passes from the rest of the team would be ranked higher.

There is also a catch as page rank also gives more weight to links from a website that has a higher page rank itself.

so a pass from a popular player (say Lionel Messi üêê) would worth more than a pass from a player that hardly gets the ball in the game.
